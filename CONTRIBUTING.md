# Contributing Guidelines

The Skills Api project welcomes contributions via GitLab merge requests.<br>
This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.


#### Merge approval and release process

The client side git hooks and Concourse Pipeline will provide you with feedback about the ongoing validity of your merge request.<br>
The removal of the wip tag effectively acts as a signal that the MR is ready for review by a maintainer.<br>
We much welcome requests for feedback about work in progress.

Once the MR has been merged, Concourse will build and release to staging for final approval.
Final approval triggers a promotion of the release into the production environment.
