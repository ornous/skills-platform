## Overview

### Spike and Stabilise
* Spike<br>
Treat your code as a time bound experiment.
Once the experiment is over, it should be *systematically removed*.<br>
Code did not prove useful: it disappears never to be remembered again. (hopefully)
* Stabilise
Congrats, your experiment proved useful.
Bring it again but this time meet the quality requirements.<br>
Use judgement and the quality gates to drive your improvements. Feedback is your friend.
